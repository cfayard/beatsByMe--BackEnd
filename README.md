# beatsByMe-v2-back-end
Created an API with 200+ sound samples for future DC students to use with class projects. It includes (Drums, Instruments, Sound Effects, and the back-end class lecture videos converted to a popular audio format).

Designed to be a database to store information for my BeatsByMe App. Once integrated, users will not only be able to continue signing up and logging back in, but they also will be able to save the data from their session to their profile. Upload their own sound files, and choose from an entire database of high-quality sound samples to upload to the pads or sequencer.


Built using: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, bcrypt.js, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.
